#  Wireless Protocol Fuzzing Framework

A modular cybersecurity project designed to identify vulnerabilities in wireless protocol implementations using fuzz testing techniques. This framework targets **WPA2, BLE, and IoT (MQTT)** protocols by generating malformed packets and monitoring system behavior.

---

##  Overview

Wireless communication protocols are widely used in modern systems such as Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth devices, and IoT ecosystems. However, these protocols often contain complex parsing logic, making them vulnerable to malformed inputs.

This project implements a **multi-protocol fuzzing framework** that:

* Generates mutated packets
* Sends them to real protocol implementations
* Monitors for crashes or abnormal behavior
* Produces structured fuzzing reports

---

##  Key Features

*  Multi-protocol fuzzing (WPA2, BLE, MQTT)
*  Modular architecture for easy extension
*  Automated packet mutation engine
*  Integration with real-world services
*  Crash monitoring and reporting system

##  Installation

###  Update System

```bash
sudo apt update
```

###  Install Required Services

```bash
sudo apt install hostapd mosquitto bluez -y
```

###  Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Usage

Run the fuzzing framework:

```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```

---

##  Sample Output

```
Wireless Protocol Fuzzer Started

Starting hostapd...

====== FUZZING REPORT ======
Target: WPA2-hostapd
Total Crashes Detected: 1
Crash: hostapd crashed at iteration 0

Starting Mosquitto...

====== FUZZING REPORT ======
Target: MQTT-Mosquitto
Total Crashes Detected: 0

Checking bluetoothd...

====== FUZZING REPORT ======

##  Results

| Protocol | Target    | Result            |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| WPA2     | hostapd   |  Crash detected   |
| BLE      | BlueZ     |  Stable           |
| MQTT     | Mosquitto |  Stable           |

---

##  Limitations

* Requires compatible wireless hardware for full WPA2 testing
* BLE fuzzing limited without external Bluetooth adapter
* Basic mutation strategy (not coverage-guided)

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Coverage-guided fuzzing (AFL-style)
* Real packet injection using Scapy
* GUI dashboard for monitoring
* Automated vulnerability classification

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how fuzz testing can be applied to wireless protocol stacks to uncover vulnerabilities. The framework successfully identifies weaknesses by injecting malformed packets into real-world services.
